The EB-2 visa NIW (National Interest Waiver) is a classification of employment-based immigration visa that allows a foreign national to skip the labor certification process and receive an employment-based green card. This visa is reserved for individuals who possess advanced degrees or exceptional abilities, and who can demonstrate that their work is in the national interest of the United States. The EB-2 NIW can be obtained without a job offer or a U.S. employer sponsor. The applicant must demonstrate that their work is in the national interest of the United States, and that the visa would benefit the U.S. economy, culture, or educational system.

Use the following checklist to ensure that you have all the necessary documents and information to apply for an EB-2 NIW. This should take over 100 hours to complete and we do recommend working with a consultant. Though, you are allowed to "self-petition" and submit the documents on your own.  

The submission for an EB-2 NIW Visa typically includes a petition letter, supporting evidence, and any available supplemental materials. The total number of pages depends on the individual case, but generally the submission would range from 20 to 50 pages. pages total for your submission.

            <td colspan=3>A petitioner has shown that the area of employment is of **substantial intrinsic merit**.  This prong is designed to reward immigrants who possess extraordinary abilities in their respective fields and who can contribute to the country in an exceptional way. Applicants must demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or must demonstrate that they possess a superior level of expertise in their profession.

The first prong, substantial merit and national importance, focuses on the specific endeavor that the 
foreign national proposes to undertake. A petitioner must establish that any proposed benefit from the individual’s endeavors will be **national in scope**. The endeavor's merit may be demonstrated in a range of 
areas such as business, entrepreneurialism, science, technology, culture, health, or education. In 
determining whether the proposed endeavor has national importance, we consider its potential 
prospective impact. </td>

We recognize that forecasting feasibility or future success may present challenges to petitioners and USCIS officers, and that many innovations and entrepreneurial endeavors may ultimately fail, in whole or in part, despite an intelligent plan and competent execution. We do not, therefore, require petitioners to demonstrate that their endeavors are more likely than not to ultimately succeed. But notwithstanding this inherent uncertainty, in order to merit a national interest waiver, petitioners must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.</td>

            <td colspan=3>This prong allows immigrants to bypass the labor certification process and receive their visa without demonstrating that there are no qualified U.S. workers available. Applicants must demonstrate that their presence in the U.S. is in the national interest and that they are able to make an exceptional contribution to their field.
<br>
The third prong requires the petitioner to demonstrate that, on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification. In 
performing this analysis, USCIS may evaluate factors such as: whether, in light of the nature of the 
foreign national's qualifications or the proposed endeavor, it would be impractical either for the 
foreign national to secure a job offer or for the petitioner to obtain a labor certification; whether, even assuming that other qualified U.S. workers are available, the United States would still benefit 
from the foreign national's contributions; and whether the national interest in the foreign national's 
contributions is sufficiently urgent to warrant forgoing the labor certification process. In each case, 
the factor(s) considered must, taken together, indicate that on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification.
